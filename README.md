# C-OOP
These are some projects I made over the summer of 2018, in which I learned C# and OOP. These projects when compiled give instructions to the user, on the Terminal window for how to use. All files neccesary to run each program are provided.

Project Descriptions:
  StopWatch was the first C# project I ever created. StopWatch functions as a StopWatch with commands. In this project a main goal was to focus on encapulation and private memebers. The user does not experience any of the underlying mechanisms used in StopWatch.
